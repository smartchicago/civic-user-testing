# Civic User Testing

This repository is meant to document the effort by the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](smartchicagocollaborative.org) to implement user testing for civic apps in the Chicago area. 

This effort is being made open source so that other communities can see what we are doing and learn from our successes and mistakes. This README.MD will detail the actual process for testing civic apps through the CUT group. 

When an app enters civic user testing, a folder will be created in the repository that will contain all the raw data including screenshots of the app, user testing scripts, anonymized testing results and change logs. 

Smart Chicago will maintain a blog about the effort on the [Civic User Testing Group website](http://cutgroup.smartchicagoapps.org). We will also blog about the progress of different apps as they go through the process. 

The actual signup page for both testers and developers is located on this [website](http://cutgroup.smartchicagoapps.org/).

## Usage

As developers sign up for civic user testing, a folder will be created for keeping raw data about the testing. Blog posts about the app itself will also be contained in this folder in a .md format. 

## Contributing 

If you are a Chicago civic developer, you can submit your app for user testing by signing up here: http://cutgroup.smartchicagoapps.org/developers.html. 

There are many lessons to be learned in an effort like this and so feedback, suggestions, and questions are more than welcome. You may submit questions or feedback by submitting an issue or contacting us directly. 

Civic developers outside of Chicago who would like to include the results of their own user testing in this repository are encouraged to submit a pull request. The more the merrier.
